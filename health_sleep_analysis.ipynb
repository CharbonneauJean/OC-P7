    "## 9. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated the complete workflow for a binary/multi-class classification task using the OpenML 'sleep' dataset (ID: 205). We performed the following key steps:\n",
    "1.  **Data Loading**: Fetched the dataset from OpenML.\n",
    "2.  **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values via imputation, identified categorical and numerical features, and applied feature scaling (StandardScaler) and encoding (OneHotEncoder) using a `ColumnTransformer`.\n",
    "3.  **Data Splitting**: Divided the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "4.  **Model Training**:\n",
    "    *   Trained a traditional Logistic Regression model as a baseline.\n",
    "    *   Trained a TabPFNClassifier, leveraging its pre-trained capabilities for tabular data.\n",
    "5.  **Model Evaluation**: Assessed both models on the test set using accuracy, F1-score (weighted), and detailed classification reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from the evaluation sections *[will illustrate / illustrate - use appropriate tense after execution]* the comparative performance of these two distinct approaches. TabPFN often provides a strong, quick-to-train baseline, particularly effective for smaller datasets like the one used here, without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. Logistic Regression, while simpler, provides a well-understood benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise highlights the utility of TabPFN as a valuable tool in the data scientist's toolkit for rapidly developing effective models on tabular data, alongside traditional, interpretable models like Logistic Regression."
